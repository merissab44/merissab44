- 👋 Hi, I’m @merissab44
- 👀 I’m interested in Mobile development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python,Flask, React-Native, and Swift.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that will allow citizens to call on each other for help instead of the police. 
It would help greatly to have someone from a front-end background.
